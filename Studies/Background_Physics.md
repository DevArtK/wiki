# Background Phsyics

Qualitative : What

Quantitative :  How much


## Atom

**Parts of an Atom**

**Nucleus** : located at the center

    - Gives an atom its identity
    - Contains two kinds of particles, *protons and neutrons*


**Protons** : Positively charged particles inside nucleus

    - All alike
    - Positively charged


**Neutrons** : Uncharged particles inside nucleus

    - All alike
    - Neutrally charged


**Electrons** : Negatively charged particles that orbit nucleus

    - Surrounds the nucleus
    - Negatively charged
    - The charge is *quantitatively* equal to, but *qualitatively* opposite from
      the charge on a proton


**Shell**

    -  Electron orbital path around the nucleus
    - Concentric circles around nucleus
    - Filled in sequence


**Valence Shell**

    - Outer most shell


**Valence**

    -  The number of electrons contained in the valence shell


**Atomic Number**

    - The number of protons in the nucleus of the atom


**Atomic Weight**

    - The mass of an atom
    - Determined by the total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus


**Isotopes**

    - Different atoms of the same element
    - Number of neutrons can vary, but no matter the number of neutrons, the
      element keeps it identity
    - Each element has one particular isotope that occurs most often in nature
    - All elements have multiple isotopes
    - Changing the number of neutrons in an element's nucleus results in a
      difference in the weight, and density


**Ions** : an electrically charged atom

    - If an atom has more or fewer electrons than protons, then the atom carries
      an electrical charge
    - Shortage of electrons produces a positive charge
    - Excess of electrons produces a negative charge
    - Element's identity remains the same

    - Positively charged ion is called a *cation*
    - Negatively charged ion is called a *anion*


**Compounds** : two different elements joined together by sharing electrons

- Often, but not always have properties that drastically differ from either (or
  any) of the elements that make them up


**Molecules** : Joined atoms of elements in groups of two or more

- When an element occurs as single atoms; monatomic
- When an element occurs as two-atom molecules; diatomic
- When an element occurs as three-atom molecules; triatomic


**Conductors** : A substance in which the electrons can move with ease

**Insulators** : Prevents electron movement among atoms, except occasionally in tiny amounts

**Dialectric** : Keeps electrical charges apart to form an *electric dipole*,
preventing the flow of electrons that would otherwise equalize the charge
difference; such as capacitors where electrons should not directly travel


**Resistors** : Manufactured component with the intent of giving it a specific
amount of conductivity

- Allows the limiting or controlling the rate of electron flow in a device or
  system
- As conductivity improves, the *resistance* decreases
- As conductivity decreases, the *resistance* increases
- Engineers strive to minimize the resistance (or ohmic value) because
  resistance converts electricity into heat, reducing the *efficiency*
