# Identifying Hot, Neutral, Ground Wires


## Identifying Hot, Neutral Ground Wires Using a Multimeter

1. Identify all three wires
2. Number them 1 - 3, or colors
3. Set multimeter to AC measurement at the maximum range (V~)
4. Measure voltage on first two wires, if 0 volts then those are ground and neutral
5. If there is a voltage result, this is the hot wire


# Difference Between Ground Wire and Neutral Wire

The neutral wire is tied to the neutral voltage point of a transformer.
- As is the ground but the neutral wire has a resistor

**There is nothing neutral on a neutral wire**

The neutral wire carries as much current(amps) as a hot wire. (Nearly identical)

- GFCI works on this principle by looking for a difference between Neutral and
  Hot wire, if it's more than 5 - 30 milli-amps it trips and turns the circuit
  off
